This version comes with an updated API for reduced boilerplate (non-breaking!).

The new API (currently available for `<Movable/>` and `<Resizable/>`), lets you apply constraints and special
behaviors using a custom hook that generates the required props for injecting into the component.

This allows us to maintain 2 levels of APIs - the lower-level API via the component's props, and the higher-level API using the custom hook.

That way, if you need some very unique behavior that the higher-level API does not support, you can always use the lower-level API.

## Features

- New hook - `useDimensions()`
- New hook - `Movable.useMove()` - for better control and easy constraint application to `Movable`.
- New hook - `Resizable.useResize()` - for better control and easy constraint application to `Resizable`.
- Resizable - new operations and constraints.
- Movable - new operations and constraints.

## Bug Fixes

* Added memoization to resizers
* Prevent user selection when resizing
* Using `borderBoxSize` instead of `contentRect` in `ResizeObserver`
