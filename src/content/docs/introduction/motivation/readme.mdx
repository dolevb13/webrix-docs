Many applications use 3rd-party component banks (like *Bootstrap/Material-UI/Tailwind*) for their UI.
While this is a good solution for some, in certain cases we want our app to provide a
unique user-experience by developing our own set of UI components.

The problem is that developing good UI components is very hard and time consuming.
Achieving the desired behavior is complex and sometimes requires you to wield
magic-like tricks to overcome browser limitations.
Moreover, making them "work" isn't enough - you also need to consider other aspects, like
accessibility, mobile-friendliness, and cross-browser support, to name a few.

What if you could build your own, custom component bank, without having to worry too much
about all these technicalities, and just focus on the presentation?

**That's where Webrix comes in.**

After building numerous UI components, we realized that there are many common challenges
that can be solved once and reused everywhere.

We then extracted those solutions into a set of small, single-purpose components, each aimed at overcoming
a specific UI challenge.

We call these components "the bricks of the web" - hence the name **Webrix**.

Component banks can be thought of as the infra-structure of a UI application.
Webrix is therfore the infra-structure of a component bank.
