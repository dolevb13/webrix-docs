import {Example, PreviewList} from 'components';

The `<Scalable/>` component can be used to create items that can be scaled in and out.
Although this can simply be done using CSS transformation, i.e. `transform: scale(...);`,
using CSS transformation by itself does not affect the normal document flow.

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transforms/Using_CSS_transforms):

> By modifying the coordinate space, CSS transforms change the shape and position of the
> affected content without disrupting the normal document flow.

This means that your scaled element only scales superficially, without changing the element's DOM size or the
position of its neighboring elements. `<Scalable/>` takes care of that by scaling the element's actual dimensions
based on the scale factor, to accurately update the document flow. This is illustrated in the examples below.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/scalable/BasicExample' height={300}/>

In this example you can see how a scale of `1` will show the content in its actual size, a scale of `0.5`
will scale the content down by 50%, and a scale of `2` will double the content size. You can also scale non-uniformly by
specifying a different scale factor for `scalex` and `scaley`.

## Document Flow

<Example file='docs/components/scalable/DocumentFlow' height={300}/>

As stated before, `<Scalable/>` scales the real dimensions of the element to accurately update
the document flow. In this example you can see how the text is pushed by the scaled element,
based on its scaled size, and not its original size.


## Scaling Example

<Example file='docs/components/scalable/Scaling' height={300}/>

In this example you can use the plus/minus buttons in order to see how the content is scaled in/out respectively.

## Examples

<PreviewList query='scalable'/>

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Scalable} from 'webrix/components';
import Scalable from 'webrix/components/Scalable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Scalable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`children`|node|`null`|Specifies the scalable content.
`scalex`|number|`1`|Specifies the horizontal scale factor where 1 represents the original size, 0.5 represents half of the size, and so on.
`scaley`|number|`1`|Specifies the vertical scale factor where 1 represents the original size, 0.5 represents half of the size, and so on.
