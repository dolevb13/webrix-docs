import {Example} from 'components';

Call a function only once in a given period of time, and delay the execution based on
a given delay after the last invocation. This hook will perform the necessary memory
cleanup automatically.

```js
const throttled = useThrottle(console.log, 500);
throttled(1); // Logs 1 immediately
throttled(2); // Call is ignored, since not enough time has passed since the previous call.
// ... Wait for 600ms
throttled(3); // Logs 3 immediately
```

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/hooks/usethrottle/BasicExample' height={200}/>

In the above example, a `mousemove` event is attached to the *Trigger Area*.
Every time the event is fired, a raw handler and a throttled handler are called, incrementing their respective counters.

## Syntax

```js
const throttledCallback = useThrottle(callback, threshold);
```

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {useThrottle} from 'webrix/hooks';
