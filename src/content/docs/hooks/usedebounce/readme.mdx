import {Example} from 'components';

Call a function only once in a given period of time, and delay the execution based on
a given delay after the last invocation. This hook will perform the necessary memory
cleanup automatically.

> for the difference between debounce & throttle

```js
const debounced = useDebounce(console.log, 500);
debounced(1); // Schedules 1 to be logged 500 milliseconds from now
debounced(2); // Cancels the previously scheduled execution, and schedules 2 to be logged 500 milliseconds from now.
```

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/hooks/usedebounce/BasicExample' height={200}/>

In the above example, a `mousemove` event is attached to the *Trigger Area*.
Every time the event is fired, a raw handler and a debounced handler are called, incrementing their respective counters.

## Autosaving

<Example file='docs/hooks/usedebounce/Autosaving' height={150}/>

In this example we use `useDebounce()` for monitoring user typing. We use a delay time of `500ms`,
so as long as the time between keystrokes is less than that, it will show a `Typing...` message.
If the user stops for more than `500ms`, the message will change to `Idle`.

This can be used for implementing things like "autosave" on text inputs, but instead of overloading the server
with requests per keystroke, we can make requests only when the user stops typing.

## Syntax

```js
const debouncedCallback = useDebounce(callback, wait);
```

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {useDebounce} from 'webrix/hooks';
import useDebounce from 'webrix/hooks/useDebounce'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {useDebounce} = Webrix.hooks;
```

### Parameters

name|type|description
---|---|---
`callback`|function|Specifies the function to be debounced.
`wait`|function|Specifies the delay in milliseconds.

### Return Value

Returns a `Function`.
